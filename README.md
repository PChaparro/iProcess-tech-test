# iProcess Technical Test

My solution for the technical test for the Junior Frontend Developer position at iProcess.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder structure

In the `src` folder you will find the following structure:

- `assets`: Images and other assets used in the project that doesn't need to be served as the static files in the `public` folder.

- `components`: **Global** components that are used in multiple pages.

- `config`: Configuration files for the project, like constants.

- `hooks`: Custom hooks that can be used **in multiple places** in the project.

- `lib`: Utility functions that are used **in multiple places** in the project.

- `pages`: The pages of the project. Each subfolder represents a page. Inside each subfolder you will find a `components`, `hooks` and `context` folders with the components, hooks and context providers used **only** in that page. This organization helps to keep high **cohesion** among all the elements that are part of a page to make it easier to maintain and understand.

- `types`: Typescript types and interfaces used **globally** in the project.
